# CVE-2026-26321 Lab - OpenClaw Path Traversal
# Vulnerable version: v2026.2.13
#
# IMPORTANT — TEST HARNESS DISCLOSURE:
#   This image includes harness.mjs, a CUSTOM Node.js HTTP wrapper that
#   replicates the vulnerable isLocalPath() + fs.readFileSync() logic from
#   OpenClaw's media.ts and the bare fetch() SSRF from docx.ts. This harness
#   is NOT part of OpenClaw — it was built by EIP to enable standalone
#   network-based PoC testing. The actual vulnerability exists in OpenClaw's
#   Feishu extension source code; the harness reproduces those exact code
#   paths over HTTP for demonstration purposes.
#
# Self-contained — clones source from GitHub during build.
# Base image matches the project's own Dockerfile
