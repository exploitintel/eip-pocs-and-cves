; CVE-2025-53833 Lab PHP Configuration
; Suppress E_WARNING to work around PHP 8.1 compatibility issues
; with erusev/parsedown-extra (undefined array key "text" in blockHeader).
; This is necessary because PHP 8.1 promotes undefined array key access
; to E_WARNING, and Laravel's error handler throws ErrorException on warnings.
; The SSTI vulnerability is unaffected by this setting.
