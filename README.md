# EIP PoCs and CVEs

> **Exploit Intelligence Platform** | [exploit-intel.com](https://exploit-intel.com) | [@exploit_intel](https://x.com/exploit_intel)
Autonomous CVE reproductions generated by [CVEForge](https://exploit-intel.com/blog/posts/cveforge-from-shannon-to-autonomous-poc/) — the Shannon fork PoC builder we built on top of the [Exploit Intelligence Platform](https://exploit-intel.com).

Each directory contains a complete, self-contained package: Docker lab environments, standalone PoC scripts (stdlib only, no external dependencies), root cause analysis, patch verification, and — when the fix looked narrow — bypass attempts against the patched version.

No hand-holding. No cherry-picked targets. One CVE number in, complete lab out.

## CVEs

| CVE | Target | Class | CVSS | Bypass? |
|-----|--------|-------|:----:|:-------:|
| [CVE-2025-53833](CVE-2025-53833/) | LaRecipe (Laravel) | SSTI to RCE | **10.0** | No |
| [CVE-2025-58159](CVE-2025-58159/) | WeGIA | File Upload to RCE | **9.9** | No |
| [CVE-2025-60355](CVE-2025-60355/) | OneBlog (Java/FreeMarker) | SSTI to RCE | **9.8** | **Yes** — "fixed" version still exploitable |
| [CVE-2025-55010](CVE-2025-55010/) | Kanboard | Deserialization to RCE | **9.1** | **Yes** — session handler bypass |
| [CVE-2025-10622](CVE-2025-10622/) | Foreman (Red Hat Satellite) | OS Command Injection | **8.0** | No |
| [CVE-2026-28372](CVE-2026-28372/) | GNU telnetd + util-linux | Privilege Escalation | **7.4** | No |
| [CVE-2026-28296](CVE-2026-28296/) | GVFS FTP Backend | CRLF Command Injection | **4.3** | **Yes** — server-supplied path injection |

Three out of seven runs ended with bypass or incomplete-fix findings. That's either bad luck or a pattern worth paying attention to.

```

## Quick Start

Every CVE follows the same pattern:

```bash
cd CVE-YYYY-XXXXX

# Build and run the lab
docker compose build
docker compose up -d

# Run the exploit
python3 poc/poc.py <target> -p <port>

# Tear it down
docker compose down
```

Check the individual README for target-specific details, ports, and credentials.

## How These Were Made

[CVEForge](https://exploit-intel.com/blog/posts/cveforge-from-shannon-to-autonomous-poc/) is a fork of [Shannon](https://github.com/KeygraphHQ/shannon) — the open-source autonomous AI pentesting framework by [Keygraph](https://keygraph.io). We rewired it to take a CVE number instead of a URL and pointed it at the [EIP MCP server](https://exploit-intel.com/blog/posts/introducing-eip-mcp-server/) for vulnerability intelligence.

Six agents, five phases, fully autonomous:

1. **Intel** — Pull the CVE brief from EIP, clone the source repo, find the vulnerable version
2. **Analysis** — Read the fix diff, trace the vulnerable code path, assess fix completeness
3. **Lab Build** — Generate Dockerfiles, build containers, verify they start
4. **PoC & Verify** — Write the exploit, confirm it works on vulnerable, confirm it's blocked on patched
5. **Report** — Generate the writeup
6. **Bypass** *(conditional)* — If the analysis flagged the fix as narrow, try to break it

Average run: ~35 minutes, ~$10. The lab build is always the bottleneck.
